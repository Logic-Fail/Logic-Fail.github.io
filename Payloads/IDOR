Well particularly there are no payloads for IDOR as it drastically depends upon the application but we will discuss some ways through which bug bounty hunters were able to discover IDOR, as a note do try 
adding the parameters if there is a possibility of IDOR: -?id=, ?users=, /user, &id= etc.

Techniques
--> In forget password if the application is sending a reset link to an email do check, if the reset link contains anything particular to the user like user id, username, and role. 
  Try intercepting forgot password requests to find if there is any involvement of user ids. 

--> Try adding a user, or id at the end of the endpoints like IDOR to add secondary users in www.example.com/businessmanage/users/api/v1/users
