Can use any tools of choice, I generally use ffuf, dirsearch and Feroxbuster

Tips:
#1 Use different wordlists depending upon the server, technology used.
#2 Don't forget to add .zip, .php, etc extension at the end of the endpoint or file this might lead to the download of the whole source code of the server
#3 Never Forget to search for the username in the directory
