Note: Below are some of the common methods used for bypassing the authentication as every application and server works differently so closely observe headers, pattern, 
irregularity or any out-of-the-place things, and analyze how the application/server reacts to the requests, devise the plan accordingly to alter the request to bypass 
the authentication.

### 1 ###
Cookie Tampering : Decode the cookie and change it's parameter like id: admin, admin: true etc.

### 2 ###
Response Manipulation (Move through KISS) : 

### 3 ###
username enumeration and brute-forcing: Check if there is a rate limit first otherwise, there is a risk of running into account lockout or block

### 4 ###
Forced browsing the contents of admin with low privilege user or with unauthenticated user

Unusual
These are some interesting ways other researchers were able to bypass the authentication

### 1 ###

Try looking for disabling the authentication mechanism by either supplying a false request to fool the server or using the request settings with PUT, POST method

### 2 ###
Response to Request manipulation: Alther the request depending upon the response of the particular request

### 3 ###
Magic link: Analyze the resemblance of the login link provided by the server to your URL or try seeing if the received login link contains guessable values
