Some application frameworks support various non-standard HTTP headers that can be used to override the URL in the original request:
Keep the GET request to "/" and then add /admin in the following headers to bypass the restricted access
X-Original-URL: /admin
X-Rewrite-URL: /admin

Adding characters in URL path like:
/*
/%2f/
/./
/
/*/

By adding different headers in requests with the value 127.0.0.1 or localhost or 127.1 can also help in bypassing restrictions.
