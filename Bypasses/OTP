Note: Do closely observe the javascript and don't forget to open the inspect element as well, Closely analyzing the response and behavior of the application is another 
move for successful OTP bypass. 

### 1 ###
Request and response manipulation
There might be a case where:
# Sometimes they might reveal the otp in the javascript of web-source code
# They might even send the entered otp and correct otp in the request as a hash 
# Very important to closely observe the response they tend to reveal the opt
# Manipulation of response is a very common method that does look or sign like otp: false, otp: 1, status: false, etc

### 2 ###
Brute-Forcing
- Do check for the rate limit and OTP expiry time and try to brute force, depending on those elements

### 3 ###
Observe the pattern
-Sometimes there might be a pattern in how the otp is generated thus figuring out that can narrow down the payloads for brute-forcing attack or even helps us to guess the OTP
